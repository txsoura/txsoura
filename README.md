# Hi There! 👋🏾 🚀

> I'm a young software engineer in constant evolution and tired of making CRUD. I've already participated in systems that are and/or have been used in Paraguay, Brazil, the United States, and Mozambique.
> I have little knowledge, and my biggest goal is to discover, learn, and improve the world. May we should work together, to make it happen.

> Currently I'm seeking to create service templates that are always used, and only call them when necessary, thus reusing code and solving problems in less time.
